  ## :pencil: Challenge Overview
The Hamming Distance challenge is of intermediate difficulty and involves the computation of the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length. The Hamming distance is a measure used in information theory and computer science to determine the difference between two strings. It finds applications in scenarios such as implementing "fuzzy search" capabilities, where small discrepancies might be allowed between the search term and the matching strings.

## :white_check_mark: Solution Overview

Key aspects of my approach to a solution include:

- String Comparison: By iterating through the strings, the solution compares corresponding characters and increments a count for every mismatch found.
  
- Error Handling: To adhere to the challenge requirement that both strings must be of equal length, the function immediately returns NaN when the input strings are of differing lengths, ensuring reliability and consistency
  
- Case Sensitivity: The solution treats differences in case as valid differences between the two strings, adhering to a strict interpretation of character equality.

:old_key: Key Features
[:x:] Accurate calculation of the Hamming distance between two equal-length strings.

:sparkles: How to Use
To use this function in your project, simply include the hammingDistance function in your JavaScript file. Here's a quick example of how to call it:

let result = hammingDistance('abcd', 'aBCd'); // Should return 2
console.log(result);
